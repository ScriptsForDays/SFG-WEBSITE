# SFG TERMINAL HUB

This is a lightweight, responsive GitHub Pages site for the SFG TERMINAL HUB — a professional-looking Roblox script hub.

Getting started

- Preview locally (from the site root) using Python's simple HTTP server:

```powershell
# in the repository root directory
python -m http.server 8000
# then open http://localhost:8000/ in your browser
```

Deploy to GitHub Pages

1. Create a new repository on GitHub and push these files.
2. In the repository settings, enable GitHub Pages from the `main` branch (root).
